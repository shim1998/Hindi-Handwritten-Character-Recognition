My attempt at recreating ,Hindi Handwriting Recognition system using Deep Learning via Keras and Python, from a research paper written by Shailesh Acharya, Ashok Kumar Pant and Prashna Kumar Gyawali.

The Link for research paper is [here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7400041)

To run the project:
```
python load.py
python jupyter notebook
```

Load.py will convert the dataset into .csv file
